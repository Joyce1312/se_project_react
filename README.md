# Weather Wardrobe

Weather Wardrobe is a responsive React + Vite web application that recommends clothing items based on the current weather. The app dynamically displays temperature in °F, filters clothing items by weather type, and lets users view and add items through modals.

- See recommended clothing items filtered by weather type (hot, warm, cold).
- Open an item modal to preview an image and description.
- Add new items through the Add Clothes form modal.
- Navigate between desktop and mobile views with a responsive header and mobile menu toggle.
